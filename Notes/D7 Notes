Day 7 Notes:-

Topics learned CSS class and IDs
Class:-
 The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.
 It matches all the HTML elements based on the contents of their class attribute.
 The . symbol, along with the class name, is used to select the desired class.

 Eg:-
  .class-name {
  /* Define properties here */
  }
ID
 The ID selector matches an element based on the value of its id attribute. 
 In order for the element to be selected, its ID attribute must exactly match the value given in the selector.
 The # symbol and the id of the HTML element name are used to select the desired element.
 
 Eg:-
 #idname {
    /* Define properties here */
  }
Difference B/W Class and ID
 The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID is only used to identify one single element in our HTML.
 IDs are only used when one element on the page should have a particular style applied to it. 
 However, a class can be used to identify more than one HTML element.
