Day 5 Notes:- 

HTML Forms :- HTML forms is a way to create a form inside a webpage.
there are 2 tags that form the base of the basic "form" format

The tags are 
 - Label > The lable tag is used to label a filed, to identify, what has to be given in that field.
 - Input > The input tag creates a section in which, user can input according to the label.

Besides, there are many attribute, which can be used to customise the form but, the form will be revisited after javascript lessons to fully make out of this feature.
