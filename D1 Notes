HTML Tags

1 - Heading tags - Heading tags are mainly of six types i.e. form <h1> - <h6> in which, h1 is the largest font supported while h6 is the smallest.
Once opened using <h2>, the tag has to closed uptil the point where the user wants the text to be enlarged and that is done by writing </h2>, "/" is added
to depict that, the tag has ended and the text between the tags is to be modified.

2 - Break line tag - The break line tag i.e. <br> is to break line at any point, similar to the heading tag, it doesn't require any closing code, it can be
used at any point, even in between of texts.

3 - Heading line tag - The heading line or <hr> tag is similar to the <br> tag meaning that, it also doesn't require a closing tag. The heading tag is just
there to put a line over any text.

4 - Centre tag - The <center> tag is used to align the text in center but it requires a closing tag, i.e. all the text between <center></center> will get aligned
int the center.

HTML Attributes

HTML attributes are the keywords, used to modify the tags
eg :- <hr color="red"> color is an attribute - in this command, the color of the line will become red.
